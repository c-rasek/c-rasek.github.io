        <h2>Literally an Icon and a Half</h2>
        <p>There are few, if any, individuals in history who embody more intelligence, more creative genius, more outright badassery than Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley.</p>
        <p>At just 19, Shelley had already transgressed countless social norms (inlcuding eloping with her famous, similarly scandalous husband), suffered unimaginable grief, and wrote what would become one of the best and most memorable horror stories of all time. Mary Shelley embodies all that is unapologetically feminist about Romanticism. She will dance eternally in the wide imagination of literature, dodging rules, hiding behinds curtains just to scare you, and pulling gleefully at the loose threads of institutionalized misogyny.</p>
        <p>Oh, and she also kept her husband's heart in a desk drawer.</p>
