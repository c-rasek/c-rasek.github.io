        <p>Hey! My name's Case, but you can call me Colton if it's easier for you to remember. I'm a senior English Major here at UNC and I'm definitely suffering from a severe case of senioritis. My pastimes include: reading, writing, listening to/making music, and worrying. Someday I hope to become a librarian.</p>
